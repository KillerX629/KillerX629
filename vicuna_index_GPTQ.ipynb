Evaluate the limit of each part separately.\\n3. Take the complex conjugate of the expression, and evaluate the limit of the complex conjugate.\\n4. Combine the limits of the real and imaginary parts and the complex conjugate to find the limit of the original expression.\\n5. If the limit exists, it will be a complex number. If the limit does not exist, the value of the expression at the point is infinity.\\n\\nFor example, let's try to find the limit of the function f(z) = z^2 + 2z as z approaches 2. We can simplify the expression as follows:\\n\\nf(z) = (2 + 2z) + 2z\\n\\nEvaluating the limit of each part separately, we get:\\n\\nlim(z->2) (2 + 2z) = 2\\nlim(z->2) 2z = 0\\n\\nTaking the complex conjugate of the expression, we get:\\n\""
